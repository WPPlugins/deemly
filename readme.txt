The official deemly plugin enables you to integrate your users’ deemly scores with your site. Make your users feel safe and enhance their activity!

== Description ==

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxTI9asvyn4]

Trust is one of the most important factors whenever people interact. deemly enables users to take advantage of their whole online reputation through one integrated score. By combining their personal ratings and reviews from different sharing economy platforms, users can display their trustworthiness immediately, instead of building their platform reputation from scratch whenever they are trying something new. With deemly, users can feel safe and interact easily, which enhances platform activity significantly. 

= Let your users take advantage of their entire reputation! =
deemly offers two services, which are both available through this plugin: the deemly score API and the deemly ratings & reviews system. With the API, you can offer your platform’s users to display their deemly profile and rating on your site. The rating & review system is a safe and easy-to-use application that can be personalized to suit your site’s design and needs. All data is securely stored and can be accessed through an admin panel.
